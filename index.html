                <p>
                    Hello There!! I'm Bhargav, currently finishing up my
                    undergraduate study at
                    <a href="https://gitam.edu/">GITAM</a>
                    University with a Computer Science & Engineering major.
                    Here, apart from doing excessive competitive programming, I
                    spent two years springing across different CS domains like
                    cybersecurity, cloud, app development, and IoT. Spending the
                    remaining two years dating deep learning. Looking ahead, I
                    want to increase my knowledge, experience, and contribution
                    to the world through graduate study.
                </p>

                    Currently, I am trying to find the contribution of
                    linguistics (Indian languages) in the causality of
                    differences in the average level of cognition (IQ) across
                    Indian states. I am trying to find a historical trend and
                    measure the correlation between age, language expertise, and
                    IQ. More importantly, I am eliminating other factors that
                    hinder the results of this theory using AI.
                </p>

                    While research is a big part of my life. I enjoy breaking
                    routine through fun collaborative projects. Feel free to
                    reach out about my research, projects or anything else I
                    might be able to help with.

                <!-- RESEARCH EXPERIENCE -->
                <h3 id="research-experience">Research Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Not all of my research endeavors resulted in papers. Those
                    which did end up getting published can be found
                    <a href="#publications">here</a>. Those with great reasons
                    to exist but had better reasons not to are as follows. These
                    works ended up becoming projects which are available on my
                    <a href="https://github.com/bharxhav">github</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Absolute Entropy from Quantum origins.</em> In this
                    paper, I tried to prove the existence of absolute randomness
                    using a simple quantum circuit. But the proof required
                    profound knowledge of theoretical physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Music Signature.</em> Here, I used a neural net with
                    music theory logic to capture the signature style of any
                    musician. But this was better off as a project than paper
                    and also required a lot of data that was copyrighted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hairstyle Generator using GANNs.</em> Everything went
                    right until the results part. The model requires changes
                    from a more experienced person in the GANN industry. It also
                    needs to be trained with tuned hyper clusters for faster
                    results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Haar cascade for ears.</em> The architecture turned out
                    to be too reductive for it to be a novel finding. Although,
                    finding the haar cascade led to interesting data from
                    analyzing human facial features.

                    <em>Effect of climate change.</em>
                    This project is too parochial and focused on my home. The
                    data set I am creating here can help develop CV algorithms
                    that can understand factors at play between the lens and the
                    object.

                <p>
                    <em>Why is my house collecting so much dust?</em> This was a
                    fun experiment that I conducted at my home with many IoT
                    sensors. I wanted to find out why summer was causing so much
                    dust on my windows after I woke up. The result, however, is
                    hilarious. Due to the hot weather of Visakhapatnam, people
                    tend to turn on their AC a lot, especially at night. This
                    caused dust to settle on my windows when I woke up.
